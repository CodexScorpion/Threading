# Threading

## Multi-Threading in Java
This is a Java program that demonstrates multi-threading using various methods in Java.

### Introduction
Multi-threading is an essential concept in modern computing, allowing applications to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. Multi-threading is particularly useful in applications that require concurrent execution of multiple tasks, as it can help to improve performance and reduce response times. In Java, multi-threading is implemented using threads, which are lightweight processes that can run concurrently within a single process.

This program demonstrates various methods of creating and running threads in Java, including:

1. Creating and starting a thread directly

2. Creating a thread using a ThreadFactory and starting it

3. Creating a thread using a ThreadPoolExecutor and starting it

4. Using a lambda expression to create and start a thread
